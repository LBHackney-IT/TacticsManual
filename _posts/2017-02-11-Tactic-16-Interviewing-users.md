If you interview just five users, you will get important insights about how your product works. The following are essential to ensure that you get valuable insights from the interviews:

<ul><li>Ask permission to record the session, but make clear that you will not keep their details unless they ask otherwise</li>
<li>Explain that they’re helping test a service - make clear you’re not testing them!</li>
<li>Make clear that you had no hand in building this - so that they don’t hold back from saying what they think</li>
<li>Give them a task before they start - eg ‘I’d like you to try to apply for a passport’</li>
<li>Ask open ended questions - eg ‘what do you expect to happen next’</li>
<li>Ask them to talk to you about what’s going on in their head - eg ‘What do you think when you see this?’</li></ul>
