It can be easy to jump towards specific solutions before you have enough evidence to be sure that any one solution is right. Once you have a solution in mind, it can be increasingly difficult to see its flaws.

This tactic enables a group to examine the key question or challenge, rather than jumping to a solution. Key challenges are expressed as open questions - eg ‘How might we give residents reassurance that we are working on their request?’ in order to generate more ideas.

Each person writes their own notes, one at a time on different Post-Its. Each Post-It begins ‘How Might We’ (write HMW in the top corner for speed). Convert your thinking into questions. These will often be responses to the interviews 

Organise the notes in themes or groups on the wall. Give each theme or group a label.
