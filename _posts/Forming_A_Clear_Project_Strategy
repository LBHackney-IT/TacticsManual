title: Tactic 21 Forming A Clear Project Strategy
---


**Problem**
This is a common problem that happens in every organisation. Big, small, public and private. This is so common in fact that there is even an illustration of the big unknown (Google ‘The Squiggle’). 
You may have experienced some, if not all, of the following on projects:

Project not starting with robust aims/goals
Conflicts of interest bringing work to a standstill
No-one knows the way forward when there is ambiguity
Arguments among stakeholders
Misguided briefing
Lack of vision

There are more besides.

**How do we stop this happening?**
There isn’t a magic bullet for these sorts of problems because there are so many factors at play, but there are ways to help things along.

A simple yet powerful tool is a type of ‘Card Sorting’ exercise to help set priorities as part of a project kick-off, although can be used any time you get a bit stuck. You could think of it like a ‘project strategy alignment’ tool. Ultimately saving time on projects and stopping projects fail for the wrong reasons.

**What is the tactic?**
The aim of any Card Sorting exercise is to set levels of priority. A Card Sort is usually used in development to understand what a user values most, but is equally able to determine what the project team value most and remove opinion from the table. 

In this tactic, participants organize topics/values into categories and rank them in order of priority. The topics/values could vary widely but are usually relating to project metrics, project aims, and even the service strategy. For example, if a project aim is to save cost that would become a card. The same goes for speed of getting someone through a service, providing better mobility, and so on.

There are two categories for this tactic, ‘Priorities’ and ‘Non-negotiables’. Priorities are ranked from high to low importance and non-negotiables are bucketed with equal importance. Once the values are sorted into the categories they can be referenced throughout the project whenever there is conflict on a decision.


**How do I use this tactic?**
Set up a ‘Kick-off’ workshop and use this exercise as part of it. This workshop should be all about team alignment and should involve all key stakeholders.
Print out, on A4 paper, some words or phrases that the piece of work could be influenced by. These could be anything, including metrics, but should relate toward the service strategy if one exists. Make sure to bring extra paper and markers to write more. 
During the workshop, lay out the A4 sheets on the table/floor/wall and gather everyone around. Then, as a group, organise and prioritise the sheets into two categories; ‘Priorities’ and ‘Non-negotiables’. These should be fairly self explanatory but non-negotiables always trump other priorities. There should be no more that eight ‘Priorities’ and no more than four ‘Non-negotiables’.
Once this is completed the team should be agreed on what the project is about. Although it’s worth noting that these priorities may change over the course of the project as new learnings arise.

**When can I use it?**
This exercise should be used at the beginning of a project to align stakeholders on what is most important, but can equally be used if the project has reached a sticking point.
