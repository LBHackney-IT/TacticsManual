It’s important to involve the team in decision-making, partly to reassure everyone that good ideas which you don’t have time to focus on won’t be lost. Getting people to vote through a show of hands can be difficult in a hierarchical context.

Dot voting enables you to quickly come to a group decision.
<ol><li>Give a dot (or a pen to make a dot) to each participant.</li><li>Ask everyone to review the goal and sprint questions</li><li>Ask everyone to vote (2-4 times, depending on the number of Post-Its) for the most useful ‘How Might We’ questions.</li><li>Consider giving the Decider double the number of votes</li><li>Take the top HMW Post-Its and put them on the relevant part of the map</li></ol>
