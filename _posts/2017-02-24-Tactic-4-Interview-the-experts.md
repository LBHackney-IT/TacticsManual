You can accelerate your understanding by interviewing just four different experts. Try to interview them as a group to develop a shared understanding. If that’s not possible, then make sure the interviewer presents the findings to the group.

Interview the project sponsor. Understand:
<ul><li>What will make this project a success?</li><li>What’s our unique advantage or opportunity?</li><li>What’s the biggest risk?</li></ul>

Understand the customer:
<ul><li>What are they doing currently to solve this problem?</li><li>Where are the key pain points?</li></ul>

Understand the subject matter expert:
<ul><li>What are the constraints of legislation or policy?</li><li>What are the opportunities and challenges of existing technology solutions, service design and regulatory arrangements?</li></ul>

Understand previous efforts:
<ul><li>What have we already tried?</li><li>To what extent has it worked and what can we understand from previous attempts?</li><li>Why does the problem remain?</li></ul>

There are key rules to sharing the outputs:
<ul><li>Iterate your existing work, making sure the interviews add colour and detail to your other work - eg amend the map</li><li>Make the findings visible - eg key statistics on the wall, key quotes</li><li>Share it across the team - present your findings</li></ul>
