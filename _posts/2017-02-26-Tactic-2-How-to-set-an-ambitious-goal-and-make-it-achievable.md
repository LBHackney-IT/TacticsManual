If you’re working in a short timeframe, it’s important to remain focused on a longer-term goal. This tactic is useful if you aren’t sure that you are going to setup a single project or don’t have a clear brief to work to.

Effective goals will normally define an outcome rather than an output. For example, the following is a better goal:

"residents having <b>enough confidence and trust</b> to <b>self-serve online</b> rather than <b>picking up the phone</b>".

Than
"A website that tells residents everything they need to know so that they don’t pick up the phone or write to us."

Because:
<ul><li>It refers to an outcome (self-serve online) rather than an output (a website)</li><li>It reflects <i>why </i>people will change behaviour (confidence and trust) rather than just <i>what </i>they will do differently (picking up the phone)</li><li>It avoids guessing what the solution might look like</li></ul>

If you're working on a project with a clear brief, it may be better to agree<a href='https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sJ7AEC23vXTMrUNZXCNV9NsiYhhRmG1KDEQWzF5W8nA/edit#heading=h.xk84ndmzzg82'> a vision statement</a>.

<h4>Make it achievable</h4>
Once you've set the goal
<ol><li>What questions do we want to answer in this sprint?</li>
<li>To meet our long term goal, what has to be true?</li>
<li>Imagine at the end of the project, we've failed. What caused that?</li>
</ol>
Rephrase assumptions and obstacles as questions.
