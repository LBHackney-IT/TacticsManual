User stories are a device for capturing what the user needs from the solution. By explaining what the user needs, it enables a designer and developer to work together to find the best way of meeting this need. This can be preferable to detailed documentation that can inadvertently add extra complexity or fail to explain what you really mean.

A user story has three parts:

<ol><li>As a [type of user]</li><li>I want to [a thing the user wants to do]</li><li>So that [why they want to do it]</li></ol>

Once youâ€™ve created lots of user stories, you can prioritise which are most important to develop in the next phase. The remainder are valuable to keep for the next stages of development.
