Vision statements traditionally take a long time to develop. However, it can be useful to have a shared vision across a team of what you’re trying to achieve - particularly if people haven’t worked together before, or if part of the team has already developed a view of what the solution should look like.

This template helps rapidly develop a vision statement for a project team:

<strong>A</strong> [insert the name of the thing - eg ‘digital service]

<strong>For</strong> [insert the types of people who will use the thing - eg older people living alone in Hackney]

<strong>That</strong> [what does it do? - eg. helps them chat to other older people]

<strong>So that</strong> [what benefit are we trying to deliver - eg. they feel less lonely]

<strong>Unlike</strong> [what’s your key point of difference - eg. charity services that have negative connotations] 


Ideally your vision statement will take less than 20 seconds to say. Print it out on a big sheet and make it clearly visible to all the team.
