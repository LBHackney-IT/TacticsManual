There are lots of ways of prototyping- from drawing pictures of what something might look like, [wireframing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Website_wireframe) or developing the web interface that a user would use, without the data or software integration that might be delivered in a full working service. 

It’s important to develop a prototype that’s good enough that the user can provide useful feedback. This is often called a ‘minimum viable product’ - the least you can get away with vs enough to be viable. 

Sometimes, startup companies will have just a webpage which ‘pitches’ the product as ‘coming soon’ and offers a box to sign-up for further information. If they get lots of sign-ups, they know it’s an attractive proposition and might develop it further. If there are few, they’ve saved the cost and time involved in actually building the product.
